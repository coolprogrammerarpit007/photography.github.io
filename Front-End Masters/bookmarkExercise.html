                <p>At first thought, the answer is, <em>"From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services</em>." But <strong>professional photographers</strong> do not produce one-third of the <em>photographs</em> used, and <em>publisher-photo-services</em> are supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.

                    <p>"The requirements of the field are well within the <em>capabilities of even the beginner in photography</em>, viz.; the ability to make good negatives and good prints, the ability to recognise news-value, and a <em>methodical plan</em> to find the market where the prints will find <em>acceptance</em>. <em>The man or woman who can meet these requirements should be fairly successful from the beginning, and will open up quickly new avenues of special work and profit</em>."

            <p>In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such is not at all necessary to the successful selling of photographs to publications.

            <p>The field—how wide is it? Get out your <em>map of the world.</em> The field for <em>making</em> photographs extends from the top margin to the bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for <em>selling</em> photographs—which is more to the point—extends over about five thousand publications which use prints; not to speak of a few score of other markets.

            <p>And how does it <em>pay?</em> Please note: "A certain <em>magazine</em> once paid <em>$100</em> for four prints of <em>sundials.</em> An amateur, who happened to be on the spot with a kodak, made over <em>$200</em> out of a head-on <em>railroad-collision.</em> A New York <em>professional netted $125</em> from the newspaper-use of a wedding-party, of considerable local prominence, which was leaving the church after the ceremony." One amateur "realised <em>$300</em> a year for two or three years from a lucky <em>snapshot</em> of eight pet rabbits in a row."</p>
